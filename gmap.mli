(** Heterogenous maps over a GADT.

    The motivation for this library originated in the area of parsing binary
    network protocols, which often contain options and extensions in the form of
    tag, length, value encodings: the set of tags and corresponding values is
    specified in some Internet standard, and later extended by using a global
    registry.  Examples are IP options, TCP options, DNS resource records, TLS
    hello extensions, X.509v3 extensions, ... These extension mechanisms usually
    include the invariant that each tag may only be present once.

    A more naive approach is to use a variant type of all known tag-value
    combinations and storing these in an association list while parsing, but
    verifying the uniqueness invariant takes quadratic ([O(n^2)]) time, and
    retrieving a specific option is only doable in linear [O(n)] time.
    Additionally, variant packing/unpacking is required.

    In gmap, {{:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_algebraic_data_type}GADTs}
    are used to provide key-dependent value types: each GADT constructor carries
    their value type.  The underlying storage mechanism uses OCaml's stdlib
    {{:http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Map.html}Map} type:
    Lookup takes [O(log n)] time.  The above mentioned uniqueness invariant can
    be verified by only using {!S.update} or {!S.add_unless_bound} (respectively
    {!S.addb_unless_bound} for insertion).

    A simple example:

{[
type _ k =
  | A : int k
  | B : string k

module K = struct
  type 'a t = 'a k

  let compare : type a b. a t -> b t -> (a, b) Gmap.Order.t = fun t t' ->
    let open Gmap.Order in
    match t, t' with
    | A, A -> Eq | A, _ -> Lt | _, A -> Gt
    | B, B -> Eq

  let pp : type a. Format.formatter -> a t -> a -> unit = fun ppf t v ->
    match t, v with
    | A, x -> Fmt.pf ppf "A %d" x
    | B, s -> Fmt.pf ppf "B %s" s
end

module GM = Gmap.Make(K)
]}

    Using [GM] is done as follows:

{[
match GM.find A m with
| Some x -> x * x
| None -> 0
]}
